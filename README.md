# Spotify-Songs
The goal of this project is to predict which songs are most popular based on the given features from the dataset. In doing so, I hope to better understand which factors contribute to song popularity. Additionally, I hope to see if there is a way to predict if the duration of a song on the billboard charts is related to song popularity. Overall, I'm interested to see how these factors affect what makes a song popular or unpopular on Spotify. I hope that this will provide more insight for song creators, as well the company, as to what songs or artists to feature more on their platform, ultimately generating more revenue for Spotify.
